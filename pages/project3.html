title: Tonic Inhibition and Traumatic Brain Injury

<h3>Tonic Inhibition<br>and Traumatic Brain Injury</h3>
The hippocampus provides a well known electrophysiological foundation to evaluate the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the inhibitory balance of a neuronal circuit. I evaluated tonic inhibitory currents and GABA induced inhibitory K+ currents after TBI. Assessing their acute and chronic changes, from the perspective of hyperactivity and hypersynchronization observed after TBI, I described impaired inhibitory imbalance in the hippocampal neuronal network.
