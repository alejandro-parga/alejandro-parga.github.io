title: Tonic Inhibition and Traumatic Brain Injury
---

<h2>Tonic Inhibition and Traumatic Brain Injury</h2>
The inhibitory neuronal circuit of the hippocampus provides a great electrophysiological basis to evaluate the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in inhibitory balance or a neuronal circuit. I evaluated tonic inhibitory currents and GABA induced inhibitory K+ currents after TBI. Assessing their acute and chronic changes, in the perspective of hyperactivity and hypersynchronization observed after TBI, I described impaired inhibitory imbalance in the hippocampal neuronal network.
