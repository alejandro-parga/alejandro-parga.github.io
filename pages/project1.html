<h2>Tracing Neuronal Circuits</h2>
Retrograde trans-synaptic tracing of a Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortico circuit using PRV-152. The biological basis of auditory hallucinations discloses an anatomical and functional circuit responsible for endogenous activation of the brain areas responsible for auditory perception. I describe a circuit relevant to the auditory function and involved in the imbalances of the dopaminergic neurotransmission related to brain disorders like schizophrenia.
