title: Activity-dependent transcriptomic programs for neuronal activation

<h3>Activity-dependent transcriptomic programs<br>for neuronal activation</h3>
I am identifying the transcriptomic programs linked to immediate early gene activation in the primate cortex implementing trageted Patch-Seq techniques and evaluating the changes in the electrophysiological properties of neurons.
