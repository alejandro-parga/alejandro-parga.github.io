title: Intrinsic Optical Signal and Cortical Spreading Depression

<h3>Intrinsic Optical Signal<br>and Cortical Spreading Depression </h3>
Targeted functional modulation of neuronal activity is possible by using opto/chemogenetics. We control the induction and spreading of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in two mouse lines. One modulating excitatory neuronal activity with a ChR2:Nex recombinant line for optogenetic induction and regulating inhibitory neuronal activity with ArChaer:Nex recombinant line for optogenetic inhibition of CSD. This animal model is useful to test pharmacological compounds like neurosteroids in their effects on CSD and brain activity.
